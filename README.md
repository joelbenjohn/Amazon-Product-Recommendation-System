# Amazon Product Recommendation System

A personalized recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques, including Rank-Based, User-User, Item-Item, and Matrix Factorization (SVD) models. The system is evaluated using metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and RMSE, and optimized with hyperparameter tuning to handle cold-start scenarios and improve user experience on e-commerce platforms.

## Project Highlights
- **Techniques Used**: Rank-Based, User-User & Item-Item Collaborative Filtering, SVD
- **Evaluation**: Precision@K, Recall@K, F1-Score, and RMSE
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- **Cold-Start Handling**: Effective predictions for new users
